## dbt-bigquery-monitoring v0.20.3 - July 01, 2025

### Fixes


  - Use dataset level for indexes tables as required by the documentation ([#128](https://github.com/bqbooster/dbt-bigquery-monitoring/issues/128))

### Under the Hood


  - Disable by default 'by folder' models as they are often problematic for users that don't have folders ([#128](https://github.com/bqbooster/dbt-bigquery-monitoring/issues/128))
