      - name: table_schema
        description: The name of the dataset that contains the table or materialized view, also referred to as the datasetId

      - name: table_name
        description: The name of the table or materialized view, also referred to as the tableId

      - name: creation_time
        description: The table's creation time

      - name: total_rows
        description: The total number of rows in the table or materialized view

      - name: total_partitions
        description: The number of partitions present in the table or materialized view. Unpartitioned tables return 0.

      - name: total_logical_bytes

        description: Number of logical (uncompressed) bytes that are more than 90 days old

      - name: total_physical_bytes
        description: Total number of physical (compressed) bytes used for storage, including active, long term, and time travel (deleted or changed data) bytes

      - name: active_physical_bytes
        description: Number of physical (compressed) bytes less than 90 days old, including time travel (deleted or changed data) bytes

      - name: long_term_physical_bytes
        description: Number of physical (compressed) bytes more than 90 days old

      - name: time_travel_physical_bytes
        description: Number of physical (compressed) bytes used by time travel storage (deleted or changed data)

      - name: table_type
        description: The type of table. For example, `EXTERNAL` or `BASE TABLE`

      - name: active_logical_bytes_cost
        description: The cost of the active logical bytes cost part of the storage in the reference currency (default values are in dollars). This active data is data that is less than 90 days old. The logical bytes are the data counted as raw (uncompressed) bytes.

      - name: long_term_logical_bytes_cost
        description: The long term cost of the active logical bytes cost part of the storage in the reference currency (default values are in dollars). This long term data is data that is more than 90 days old. The logical bytes are the data counted as raw (uncompressed) bytes.

      - name: active_physical_bytes_cost
        description: The cost of the active physical bytes cost part of the storage in the reference currency (default values are in dollars). This active data is data that is less than 90 days old. The physical bytes are the data counted as compressed bytes.
      
      - name: long_term_physical_bytes_cost
        description: The long term cost of the active physical bytes cost part of the storage in the reference currency (default values are in dollars). This long term data is data that is more than 90 days old. The physical bytes are the data counted as compressed bytes.

      - name: time_travel_physical_bytes_cost
        description: The cost of the time travel physical bytes cost part of the storage in the reference currency (default values are in dollars). This time travel data is the historical data (that has been deleted or changed). The default time travel window is 7 days. The physical bytes are the data counted as compressed bytes.
